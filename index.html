				French monasteries, British royalty, croquet and the invention of rubber have all been instrumental in the evolution of tennis over the last millennium. The game of “name je de paume('game of the hand) that originated in the 12th century in the French monasteries has evolved over the years into a sport that is now in the list of top ten sports in the world based on participation.  Tennis Industry Association (TIA) executive director Jolyn de Boer says “The fact that tennis is one of only two traditional sports in the U.S. with positive growth over the past 12 years is a testament to tennis not only being a 'sport of a lifetime,' but also to the concerted and collaborative efforts across this industry to grow the sport”. “According to additional data from the annual PAC study, tennis is the only traditional sport with positive linear growth in participation rates between kids ages 6 to 17.”
				According to Martina Navratilova, one of the greatest tennis players the world has witnessed “The tennis ball doesn't know how old I am. The ball doesn't know if I'm a man or a woman or if I come from a communist country or not. Sport has always broken down these barriers.” What was once a “gentlemen’s sport” has now evolved into a highly competitive and lucrative game for the professional players involved in it. A total of $50.4 million was awarded in the year 2017 at the US Open, making it one of the richest tournaments in the history of modern tennis.
				The tennis racquet has seen a huge evolution in the last 1000 years.  From the bare palms in  “Jeu de puame” in the 12th century to the “piezo electric” ones in the 21st century, the tennis racquet has evolved with the invention of steel, composites and piezo electric material. This study tracks the growth and the evolution of the tennis racquet historically in the last millennium.
